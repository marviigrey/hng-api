In this project we will be implementing IPAM(aws IP address manager) using
terraform. The IPAM helps to plan track and monitor the IP addresses of our 
aws workloads.

Procedures:
1. Deploy IPAM
2. Create an IPAM root pool
3. Deploy IPAM Child pools
4. create a VPC in 2 regions: us-east-1 and us-east-2.


We will be using the AWS cloud9 to perform this task because it has the terraform
preinstalled and also our aws profile already configured.

we can run terraform --version to test if terrform is already installed.
